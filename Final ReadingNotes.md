# Cloud Concepts Overview

Cloud provides its users with storage space, processing capacity, and software, making it easier for them to
a better cloud services where you can flexibly log in and access your files as many times as you like
necessary.

Four Pillars Of an IT

1. Infrastructure
2. Development
3. Security 4.Data

# Cloud Economics, Billing & Support

The economy of the cloud is in charge of studying the costs and benefits of computing since it is in charge of organizing, 
building the key to the cases, and evaluating,creating a vision and strategy for said information.

Amazon Web Service (AWS)

It is an online platform where various solutions for cloud computing are provided which it offers many operations for computing, 
storing databases, analysis among other applications with the purpose to provide help and sastisfy these companies to develop and perform 
through the application having more capacity and benefits in the services it in the services it provides.

AWS Payment models: Key Principles

Three fundamental drivers of cost

- Compute: Charged per hour/ Second Varies by instance type

- Storage : Changed typically per GB

- Data Transfer: Outbound is aggregated and charged Inbound has no charge (with some exceptions) Charged typically per GB

# Cloud Global Infrastructure

Cloud computing allows you to store data and files, among others, that benefit through the Internet.
with the purpose of facilitating its users by providing them with better quality, security, flexibility, innovation, economics
by having your data in the cloud.

The global Infrastructure is a designed to give you better flexibility to choose where and how you want running the workload also provides
cloud computing security with high quality performance of the global network.

AWS Regions

These regions are isolated from each other, since they have a specific location to run their resources. without any problem because each region 
is divided into several zones. 

- Geographical area.
- Data replication acroos regions is controlled by you.
- Comunication between Regions uses AWS backbone network Infraestructure.
- Each Reion provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network.
- A Region typycally consist of two or more availibility zones.
 
# Cloud Security

Cloud security is responsible for protecting applications, data and infrastructure that are at risk of suffering a cyber attack.
to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the information that is stored in the cloud safely and privately, although cybersecurity has its risks, however one of these may be having little security in your information by doing so.
It is easier for you to be attacked by malware that causes everything to be deleted from your system, you are also prone to suffer from a cyber attack in which the attacker enters your system by injecting a virus to facilitate better
Your task is to acquire any information that is useful, such as credit cards where they can make purchases that you have not authorized.

One of the first steps you should take is to recognize the risk that can lead to you not being protected. your information :

- Hacker, attacker or intruder tries to find the weaknesses of the software to create a virus in order to steal or alter the information.

- Malicious code, also known as malware, is based on unwanted programs or files that help cause harm. to the device to compromise the data that is stored on the computer since malicious codes include viruses, worms and trojan horse in which
it makes the computer system go crazy which It is even almost impossible to recover the computer system.

- Vulnerabilities: they are found in the software, firmware or hardware, this is where the attacker takes advantage to gain entry to the device and begin to perform actions that are not authorized, thus successfully infecting the computer with malware.

Minimize the risks of Cyberattacks:

- Keep software up to date.
- Run up-to-date antivirus software.
- Use strong passwords.
- Change default usernames and passwords.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Install a firewall.
- Be suspicious of unexpected emails.

# Networking & Content Delivery

Computer Network

Computer networking is the interconnection of multiple devices, dominated by hosts, which are connected in multiple routes with the sole purpose of sending and receiving data, there are also multiple devices that help in communication between 
two or more devices which are known as network devices (Router, Switch, Hub and Bridge).

The OSI Model layers are as follows:

OSI stand for Open Systems Interconnection is for transmitting messages and is a reference model that specifies standards. of protocols for communication which is defined in seven layers.

- Layer 7 - Application: closest to the end user.
- Layer6- Presentation: establishes context between application-layer entities,in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics
- Layer 5- Session: controls the dialogues (connections) between computers.
- Layer 4 - Transport: provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.
- Layer 3 - Network: provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from one node to another connected in "different networks".
- Layer 2 - Data Link: Provides node-to-node data transferâ€”a link between two directly connected nodes
- Layer 1 - Physical: Responsible for the transmission and reception.

Internet Gateway

It is an internet gateway, where it allows communication between VPC and the Internet.

- Network Address Translation (NAT)

- NAT Gateway: is a network address translation gateway where it allows instances of the private subnet connects to the Internet or other services.

- NAT Instance: is a network address translation which a public VPC subnet allows that private subnet instances initiate outgoing IPv4 traffic


# Compute

It is a physical server that feeds the operating system through the storage infrastructure,
processor and memory provided with the sole purpose of providing better quality service.

An operating system manages all of the software and hardware on the computer in which there are several programs that they run at the same time and need access to the central processing unit CPU, 
memory and storage of computers because the operating system coordinates and guarantees that all programs get what they want. they need.

Types of operating systems

- Windows.
-Mac OS.
- Unix
- Linux
- Solaris
- Google Chrome

- Virtual Machines: is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

- Containers: Many different container services including Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon El-astic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

- Serverless: AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers you pay only for the compute time you consume

- Platform as a service: allows a company to focus on building code and applications rather than manage infrastructure.

- In AWS, compute is available in three forms: instances, containers, and functions.

# Storage

storage allows users to store, save and backup all their information in the cloud,
to provide them with better availability and access at any time the user wants to access
your data.

Storage Hardware 

In a computer, there are two types of storage: Volatile and Non-Volatil.

Disaster Recovery and Technology

In a company, data is valuable where it must be accessed easily and securely, protecting its data, which must be to make decisions about how they will access
the files, back them up, and also make backup copies to avoid having lost either by a disaster or by other means that compromise decisions in the storage infrastructure.

Storage in the Enterprise 

A single disk is enough for a computer to run the system and save its data, but a single disk for business would not be enough since these companies have hundreds 
and thousands of employees which require IT solutions of intensive use, and a storage solution that allows you to make backup copies and store data.

# Databases

It is a collection of information or structured data that is used to support the activities of an organization. This can be seen as a repository of data that is normally stored 
electronically in the computer system since The database is controlled by a system.

Database Properties:

- It is a representation of some aspect of the real world or a collection of data elements (facts) representing real-world information.
- A database is logical, coherent and internally consistent.
- A database is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.
- Each data item is stored in a field.
- A combination of fields makes up a table.

Database Management System

Is a collection of programs that allows users to create and maintain databases and thus control access to this database However, its main objective is to provide the database to be convenient, efficient and fast for users.
do not have any problem when it comes to recovering and storing your information.

# Cloud Architecture

It is a key element in the compilation of the cloud which is related to the design, technology components
of the ube such as hardware, software capabilities among others with the sole purpose of facilitating the structure to be effective, efficient and logical so that it allows them to work without
no problem.

Well Architecture Framework

It allows you to learn how the architecture aligns in the cloud however this helps you prepare for audits or describe key concepts, for design principles.

As we can observe The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization

General Design Principles

- Stop guessing capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data

# Automatic Scaling & Monitoring

Ensures that the application has the computing capacity it needs and eliminates any need to monitor manually the serviceability.

Monitoring with CloudWatch

allows you to create alarms to take actions about the infrastructure resources that are deployed to record monitoring logs using custom files and also to create rules that indicate events of interest, 
however cloudWatch is responsible for monitoring the AWS resources and applications that are They execute in real time.

Load Balancing

Is responsible for distributing computational workloads between two or more computers for the purpose Load balancing to divide network traffic 
between multiple servers, reducing stress on each server and make them more efficient and have good performance in links to external sites and reduce 
the latency of links to an external site by balancing the load which is very essential for that applications work correctly without any difficulty.
